## Ted Talks
I provide an example in this repository where I crawled 17 pages of Ted Talks and scrapped the data from them. See `ted_talks.ipynb` for an overview of the project and an example of the code. See `ted_talks_automated.ipynb` to see the code I wrote to automatically crawl all 17 pages, scrap appropriate data, store them into a `pandas` dataframe and then save to a `.csv` file that is located in the `data` folder.
